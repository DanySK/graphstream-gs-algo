/**
 * Random Euclidean graph generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator creates random graphs of any size. Links of such graphs are
 * created according to a threshold. If the Euclidean distance between two nodes
 * is less than a given threshold, then a link is created between those 2 nodes.
 * Calling {@link #begin(Graph)} put one unique node in the graph, then
 * {@link #nextElement()} will add a new node each time it is called and connect
 * this node to its neighbors according to the threshold planar Euclidean
 * distance.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator has the ability to add randomly chosen numerical values on
 * arbitrary attributes on edges or nodes of the graph, and to randomly choose a
 * direction for edges.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A list of attributes can be given for nodes and edges. In this case each new
 * node or edge added will have this attribute and the value will be a randomly
 * chosen number. The range in which these numbers are chosen can be specified.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default, edges are not oriented. It is possible to ask orientation, in
 * which case the direction is chosen randomly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, the graph is generated in the plane (2 dimensions) . Cartesian
 * coordinates on nodes will be generated at random. So, each node will
 * automatically be given two attributes: "x" and "y". If a dimension is
 * specified, then |dimension| attributes are generated, and the 2-norm distance (<a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">Euclidean distance</a>)
 * is considered in that dimension between the nodes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the dimension is 2, then attributes "x" and "y" are defined for each node.
 * If dimension is 3, then attributes "x", "y" and "z" are used. For other
 * values of dimension, |dimension| attributes are defined ("xi" with "i" \in
 * |dimension|) .
 * </p>
