/**
 * Full graph generator.
 *
 * <p>
 * Probably not very usefull, still sometimes needed. This genertor creates
 * fully connected graphs of any size. Calling {@link #begin(Graph)} put one
 * unique node in the graph, then {@link #nextElement()} will add a new node
 * each time it is called.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator has the ability to add randomly choosed numerical values
 * on arbitrary attributes on edges or nodes of the graph, and to randomly
 * choose a direction for edges.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A list of attributes can be given for nodes and edges. In this case each
 * new node or edge added will have this attribute and the value will be a
 * randomly choosed number. The range in which these numbers are choosed can be
 * specified.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default, edges are not oriented. It is possible to ask orientation, in 
 * which case the direction is choosed randomly.
 * </p>
